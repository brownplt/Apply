Disembark from Embark 2011

Instructions
------------

$ mkdir data # XML files go here
$ mkdir docs  # Submitted documents go here

Edit disembark.py: add your username and password

$ ./disembark.py

The script does the following:

   - Downloads XML
   - Dumps the XML to client/data.js as JSON so you can look at it.
   - Downloads PDFs referenced by the XML (including .doc and .rtf files ...)
 
Edit it to tweak.

If a file is already downloaded (either XML or PDF) the script will not download
it again. So, you can incrementally tweak how the XML is processed without
downloading over and over again.
